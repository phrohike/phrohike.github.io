<!-- Keith Brady's Cybersecurity Portfolio -->

# About Me

Hello all! My name is Keith Brady, and I am an IT/Cybersecurity nerd with 20 years of experience in Information Technology. I have worked at some amazing non-profits, helping to create a better world for people through improvements in education (k-college), biosciences and medical education (Drs, PAs, NPs, DOs and Nurses). I have been obtaining my Bachelor of Sciences in Cybersecurity with a Data Analytics minor at SHNU where I have maintained a 3.8+ GPA and made the Honor Roll every term. I started school 1.5 years ago with some transfer credits for previous college work and certifications. My interest in Cybersecurity started a long time ago but it became the industry I wanted to get into since helping a previous employer obtain a SOC 2 certification. We had to analyze our current company and all of its intricacies, assess and develop frameworks and controls, and finally implement them all. This enabled us to follow SOC 2 trust principles: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Since then, I have learned a lot more cybersecurity frameworks, tools, platforms, analysis, coding, and methods. 

Please check out some of my projects and other areas of interest below.
